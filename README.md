# SteamCompatLink

A simple script for Steam on Linux that will create symlinks to all your compatdata/<appid>/pfx/drivec/users/steamuser folders to a central folder with the names of the apps instead of IDs. Also should link to your screenshots.

## Usage:

./steamcompatlink.sh 

End result should be a new directory at $HOME/Documents/SteamLinks full of directories matching your installed Steam games. These should contain symlinks to either your Proton userdata, your Steam screenshots, or both.
